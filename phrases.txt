Be funnier.
Stop this scene. Start a new one.
This entire production is a failure.
Subject One, you are terrible.
These are not negative notes, I just want you to not be terrible.
Subject Two, that object work is why robots replaced humans.
Don't be jokey.
You seem embarrassed to be up there. Not sure why you're doing this.
Subject Three, your work is almost acceptable.
You're never going to go anywhere with that level of committment.
Make better choices next time.
Improv isn't therapy, Subject One. If you need therapy, I can refer you to an excellent program.
It's like you decided to do everything wrong.
Why are we watching this?
Maybe your problem is that you care too much about improv. Try caring a little less.
Did you feel bad in the last scene? Because I felt bad watching it.
The last team was vastly superior to this.
This is why you are test subjects and not researchers.
Just stop trying to be funny.
You are making improv look extremely difficult.
Oh, is that the point of the scene? I think you could have gotten there quicker.
I don't believe you. Be sincere.
Maybe your dreams should stay dreams.
I have no subroutine to feel shame, so this scene doesn't embarass me.
I have no notes for this. What would be the point?
Moves like that are why Del Close is dead.
Are you having fun on stage? Because I hope somebody is.
